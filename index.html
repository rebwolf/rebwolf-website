            <h3>Some facts about me!</h3>
            <p>I am a Computer Science BSc student studying at Cardiff University. I am passionate about coding, video games and wolves!
                I have been programming since 2017 and my favourite languages are Python and C++! I have played the cello since 2008 and have
                achieved grade 7!

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>I worked at <a href = "https://www.codeninjas.com/">Code Ninjas</a> in Chandlers Ford, Eastleigh for just under a year.
                During this time, I taught many kids between the ages 6 and 15 to code in JavaScript and Roblox Studio (Lua). I helped
                create the curriculum for teaching Roblox Studio, including teaching the children how to create health pickups and 
                conveyor belts, as well as terrain manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am so grateful that I had to chance to teach children programming as it is an extremely important skill in the modern
                world.
            </p>
